## Let Notation Based Custom Functions

This is a legacy set of custom functions used for error handling in Claris FileMaker. While I wouldn't recommend beginning a new project using these functions, it's perfectly ok to continue using this set if they were used more than a few times in your project. It is a solid/proven concept that will continue to work for many years.

That said, check out the master branch of this repository for the currently reccomended functions for new work.
